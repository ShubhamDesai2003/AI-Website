                <p>

                    Robotics is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that combines AI techniques with mechanical
                    engineering to design, develop, and operate intelligent machines called robots. These robots are
                    capable of performing physical tasks autonomously or with human guidance. Robotics aims to create
                    machines that can perceive their environment, make decisions based on sensory inputs, and interact
                    with the world in a purposeful manner.

                    Robotic systems involve various components and technologies. Sensing technologies such as cameras,
                    lasers, and tactile sensors enable robots to perceive and understand their surroundings. These
                    sensors provide information about the environment, object detection, and localization.

                    Robotics heavily relies on AI algorithms and techniques for decision-making. Machine learning
                    algorithms, such as reinforcement learning, enable robots to learn from experience and improve their
                    performance over time. Planning and control algorithms allow robots to generate optimal paths,
                    manipulate objects, and navigate complex environments.

                    Robots are employed in numerous industries and domains. In manufacturing, they automate repetitive
                    and dangerous tasks, leading to increased efficiency and safety. In healthcare, robots assist in
                    surgeries, provide patient care, and aid in rehabilitation. Robots are used in logistics and
                    warehousing for material handling and order fulfillment. They can also be found in agriculture,
                    exploration, transportation, and entertainment industries.

                    Collaborative robots, also known as cobots, are designed to work alongside humans in a shared
                    workspace. They are equipped with sensors and AI algorithms to ensure safe and efficient interaction
                    with human operators.

                    The field of robotics is advancing rapidly, driven by advancements in AI and automation. Ongoing
                    research focuses on developing robots with improved perception, dexterity, adaptability, and
                    learning capabilities. The ultimate goal is to create intelligent machines that can operate in
                    dynamic and unstructured environments, understand human intent, and seamlessly collaborate with
                    humans to accomplish complex tasks.
