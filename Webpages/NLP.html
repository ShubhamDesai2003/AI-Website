                    Natural Language Process
                </div>

                <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the
                    interaction between computers and human language. Its primary goal is to enable computers to
                    understand, analyze, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful and useful.

                    NLP involves various tasks and techniques. Tokenization is one of the initial steps in NLP, breaking
                    down text into individual words, phrases, or sentences. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging assigns
                    grammatical labels to words, providing insights into their syntactic roles. Named Entity Recognition
                    (NER) identifies and classifies named entities like person names, locations, organizations, and
                    dates.

                    Sentiment Analysis determines the sentiment or opinion expressed in text, whether it is positive,
                    negative, or neutral. Text Classification categorizes text into predefined categories or classes,
                    such as document classification or spam detection. Language Modeling builds statistical models to
                    predict word sequences, forming the basis for various NLP tasks.

                    Machine Translation translates text from one language to another, while Question Answering systems
                    understand and respond to questions posed in natural language. Text Generation creates human-like
                    text or generates coherent sentences based on prompts or training data. Dialogue Systems build
                    conversational agents or chatbots capable of understanding and generating natural language
                    responses.
                    <br>
                    NLP techniques often leverage machine learning approaches, including deep learning models like
                    recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformers.
                    Pretraining on large text corpora, such as with models like BERT, GPT, and Transformer-XL, has
                    greatly advanced NLP performance.

                    NLP finds applications in diverse domains. It helps analyze customer feedback, sentiment on social
                    media, and document classification. It facilitates machine translation, automated content creation,
                    and chatbot development. NLP continues to evolve rapidly, pushing the boundaries of what computers
                    can achieve in understanding and utilizing human language.
